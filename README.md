progress on replicating ref.jpg but in a different style

original art: Edgar Degas, 'Dancers, Pink and Green', oil on canvas
Degas draws in a very refined style, as exemplified by the dancers' dress and the smooth background. It's likely he used both brushes and his fingers to perfect this pastel style.
However, in my verison, I'll recreating his painting but with a more defined and rugged style, through buildup from brushes and knife work. Each hour (or so) will be tracked with a file named that hour. (1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.)
